<div id="aboutBackground" class="rounded"> <div id="aboutTitle">About Us</div><br/><div id="aboutContent">ClassiWhale began with six friends, a whiteboard covered in ideas, and a desire to build something innovative. Living in the same dorm at Stanford and all majoring in computer science, we had an opportunity of a lifetime, to take a shot at founding a company in Silicon Valley. On October 10th, 2010 we agreed to create ClassiWhale, and after replacing our beds with couches to make a common workspace, we set to work.<br/><br/>Our goal was to fix a common problem: having to skim through hundreds of news articles, messages from friends, and blog posts to find the gold nuggets actually worth reading. Nowadays, the Internet simply has too much content, and we’re forever skimming for headlines that suit our interests.<br/><br/>Arguably, Twitter suffers the most from this problem (Pear Analytics classified 41% of tweets as “pointless babble”), so we built a tool to give our fellow tweeters some help. The name ClassiWhale is no secret. It’s a play on Twitter’s infamous Fail Whale, acknowledging Twitter’s failure to consistently provide quality content. Our ClassiWhale is smart enough to do the skimming for you, showing only the tweets you care about.<br/><br/>Today, we’re continuing to make improvements to ClassiWhale, sketching algorithms on window panes and sleeping on the same couches. We hope you enjoy our bow-tied whale as much as we do. </div></div>
