Here is a brief overview of the django-specific packages we are using in our project - more will be added later as I think of them. As always, for more information just look them up online.

django-annoying: This package simplifies a bunch of the "annoying" things about django.

django-extensions: Provides some extra functionality to django. (Please do not use the dumpscript command - it will not work on our models).

django-debug-toolbar: This provides the side debug toolbar allowing you to examine the stacktrace / templates / sql queries being hit. It shows up in local development. Will not show up for non-debug!

django-picklefield: Adds a pickled object field to models - store arbitrary objects.

django-piston: Automagically creates an api for our project.

django-celery: Allows scheduling of asynchronous tasks through rabbitMQ. (Aka don't use cron)

django-css: Compiles and compresses css/less as well as javascript to form one file on the production server. Feel free to modularize js/css files or use a higher level css language like less while testing, this takes care of the rest.

south: Handles database migrations.
