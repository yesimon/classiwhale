Hi,

I saw that you created a Python program named crunchy.
There is already a program with that name (http://code.google.com/p/crunchy)
that has been in development for more about 4 years.
A co-developer and myself have given talks on Crunchy for each of the
past three years at Pycon ... so it is getting well known in the community.

I have not yet created an egg for it as I was waiting for 1.0 final ...
So your program name would create some serious problems for distribution.

Would you mind changing the name of your program?    

Regards,

Andr√©
