Basics
======

Several kinds of events trigger signals, you can connect to these signals
to perform actions as they trigger.

Example connecting to the :data:`task_sent` signal:

.. code-block:: python

    from celery.signals import task_sent

    def task_sent_handler(sender=None, task_id=None, task=None, args=None,
                          kwargs=None, **kwds):
        print("Got signal task_sent for task id %s" % (task_id, ))

    task_sent.connect(task_sent_handler)


Some signals also have a sender which you can filter by. For example the
:data:`task_sent` signal uses the task name as a sender, so you can
connect your handler to be called only when tasks with name ``"tasks.add"``
has been sent by providing the ``sender`` argument to
:class:`~celery.utils.dispatch.signal.Signal.connect`:

.. code-block:: python

    task_sent.connect(task_sent_handler, sender="tasks.add")
